Proposal:
We would like to implement an interpreter for the language defined in p2 using Scala.  This would build upon our previous work by allowing us to work with a programming language which is both object-oriented and functional, and give us the chance to take advantage of those features. 
It would also allow us to better understand the code which was provided to us inthe lexer because we will have to re-implement it.
Furthermore, Scala lacks the same emphasis on certain features such as pointers, which lower-level languages like C possess.  We expect that this project will give us even more appreciation for these tools.
We have also never programmed in Scala before, and we feel that this would be an excellent opportunity to learn it.
